# Introduction

This repository is indented to provide scripts to modify MTCD ROMs for many of those Chinese headunits you can buy on Ebay, Alibaba etc. 

# Requirements

- Linux 32bit or 64bit
- git

*If you use a 64bit Linux installation you have to install 32bit libs to get the support tools running!*

e.g. on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS use this:

`apt-get install lib32ncurses5 lib32z1`

# Installation

1. git clone https://github.com/da-anton/MTCD_ROM-cooking/
2. cd MTCD_ROM-cooking
3. download a MTCD ROM to the folder orig_dupdate.img
4. ./start_mod.sh
5. choose what you want
6. the final ROM is in the folder mod_dupdate.img
